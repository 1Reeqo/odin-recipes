    <h2>How to make rosemary lemon grilled chicken </h2>
    <p>This simple, sensational marinade and sauce for grilled chicken is made with <br>
        lemon, garlic, rosemary, and butter. Separate the marinade into thirds: <br>
        1/3 for marinating, 1/3 for basting, and 1/3 for topping.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>6\(6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

    <h3>Where to begin:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, and lemon juice together. <br>
            Pour 1/3 of the blended mixture into a small bowl for marinade. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Rub chicken breasts with marinade. <br>
            Place chicken breasts on a platter, cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours. </li><br>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer half of the <br>
            reserved rosemary and lemon mixture into a bowl for basting. Cover remaining mixture, <br>
            and set aside for topping cooked chicken.</li><br>
        <li>Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with rosemary and lemon basting mixture, <br>
            about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should <br>
            read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken breasts from the grill, <br>
            and top with remaining rosemary and lemon mixture. </li>
